<summary>‚ö° Declarative vs Programmatic</summary>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Core Difference

| Aspect          | Declarative Development                                                   | Programmatic Development                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**  | Point-and-click configuration using Salesforce‚Äôs built-in tools.         | Writing custom code (Apex, LWC, Aura, etc.).                       |
| **Tools**       | Flow Builder, Approval Processes, Validation Rules, Page Layouts, App Builder | Apex Classes & Triggers, Lightning Web Components, Visualforce, SOQL/SOSL |
| **Complexity**  | Best for **simple to moderately complex** requirements.                   | Best for **complex, highly customized** requirements.              |
| **Maintenance** | Easier to maintain, less risk.                                            | Requires maintenance, testing, deployments.                        |
| **Performance** | Optimized internally by Salesforce.                                       | Developer must ensure performance/scalability.                     |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Decide

**Rule:** _Start declarative, go programmatic if needed._

1. **Check if it‚Äôs possible declaratively** ‚Üí If yes, use declarative.
2. **Assess complexity** ‚Üí Loops, recursion, multi-object logic? ‚Üí Go Apex.
3. **Consider performance & limits** ‚Üí If declarative hits limits ‚Üí Go Apex.
4. **Maintenance & skillset** ‚Üí Admin-maintained? ‚Üí Declarative.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Common Examples

| Requirement                                        | Preferred Approach      | Why                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Send email on Case closure                         | Declarative (Flow)      | Simple automation                                    |
| Auto-update related records w/ complex filtering   | Apex Trigger            | Multi-object logic                                   |
| Custom UI for data entry                           | LWC                     | Interactive, dynamic UI                              |
| Approval process for expense reports               | Declarative (Approval)  | Built-in feature                                     |
| Integration with external payment gateway          | Apex                    | Requires HTTP callouts & custom handling             |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Answer

> "Declarative development uses tools like Flow, Validation Rules, and Approval Processes ‚Äî faster to build and easier to maintain for simpler needs. Programmatic development uses Apex, LWC, or Visualforce for complex logic, integrations, or UI.  
> My approach: start declarative to leverage Salesforce‚Äôs capabilities, and move to programmatic only if requirements exceed what‚Äôs possible declaratively ‚Äî e.g., for complex data processing, API integrations, or custom UI."

‚úÖ **Pro Tip:** Mention **governor limits, maintainability, and complexity** when deciding.

<summary>üîÑ Flows</summary>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What Are Flows?

Declarative automation tool to collect, process, and manipulate Salesforce data without code. More powerful than Workflow Rules/Process Builder.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Flows

1. **Record-Triggered** ‚Äì Runs on record create/update/delete.  
2. **Scheduled-Triggered** ‚Äì Runs at a set time or interval.  
3. **Screen Flow** ‚Äì Interactive, takes user input.  
4. **Autolaunched** ‚Äì No UI, triggered by Apex/Flows/REST API.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases

- Auto-update related records  
- Send emails/notifications  
- Create records from events  
- Data cleanup jobs (scheduled)  
- Multi-object business logic

**Example:** On Opportunity Closed Won ‚Üí update Account status, create task, send email.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Calling APIs from Flows

- **Since Winter ‚Äô23** ‚Üí Direct REST API callouts using **HTTP Callout** action.  
- **Before Winter ‚Äô23** ‚Üí Call an Apex method from Flow to handle API call.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Answer

> "Flows are Salesforce's most powerful declarative automation tool, running on triggers, schedules, or user input. I use them for updating related records, sending notifications, or guiding data entry. Since Winter '23, Flows can make REST API callouts directly; before that, we used Apex for callouts."

<summary>üåê Integrations</summary>

## Definition
Salesforce integrations enable data exchange with external systems. Broad categories:

- **Inbound** ‚Äì External ‚Üí Salesforce  
- **Outbound** ‚Äì Salesforce ‚Üí External  

---

<details>
<summary>üì• Inbound (External ‚Üí Salesforce)</summary>

**Definition:** External systems send data/requests into Salesforce.

**Methods:**
- REST API (JSON)
- SOAP API (XML)
- Bulk API v1/v2 (large data)
- Apex REST/SOAP (custom endpoints)
- Platform Events (external publish)

**Security:** OAuth 2.0, Named Credentials, JWT.

**Example:** ERP pushes invoices to Salesforce.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>üì§ Outbound (Salesforce ‚Üí External)</summary>

**Definition:** Salesforce sends data/triggers to external systems.

**Methods:**
- Apex HTTP Callouts (REST/SOAP)
- Flow HTTP Callouts (no-code)
- Outbound Messages (SOAP, declarative)
- Platform Events / CDC
- Virtual (Salesforce Connect, External Objects)

**Security:** Named Credentials, OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth, Mutual TLS.

**Example:** Send lead data to marketing automation in real time.

</details>

---

**Extra:**  
Bidirectional = mix of inbound + outbound, with sync rules.  
Choose method based on **timing** (real-time/batch), **volume**, **maintenance**.
